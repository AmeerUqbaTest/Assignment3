## Design Pattern Implementation

### 1. Factory Pattern (Creational)
**Implementation**: `ProductFactory` in `Factories/ProductFactory.cs`

The factory pattern is used to create different types of products (Electronics, Clothing, Books, HomeGarden) without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

**Benefits**:
- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Provides flexibility to add new product types
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

**Example Usage**:
```csharp
var factory = new ProductFactory();
var product = factory.CreateProduct(ProductCategory.Electronics, parameters);
```

### 2. Singleton Pattern (Creational)
**Implementation**: 
- `ConfigurationManager` in `Singletons/ConfigurationManager.cs`
- `Logger` in `Singletons/Logger.cs`

Both singletons are implemented with thread-safe lazy initialization to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application lifecycle.

**Benefits**:
- Ensures single point of configuration and logging
- Thread-safe implementation
- Global access point

**Key Features**:
- Thread-safe using `Lazy<T>` initialization
- Configuration manager stores application settings
- Logger provides centralized logging with timestamps

### 3. Strategy Pattern (Behavioral)
**Implementation**: Payment strategies in `Strategies/` folder

Supports multiple payment methods that can be swapped at runtime:
- Credit Card Payment
- PayPal Payment
- Bank Transfer Payment
- Cryptocurrency Payment

**Benefits**:
- Allows runtime selection of payment algorithms
- Easy to add new payment methods
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

**Example Usage**:
```csharp
var paymentContext = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardPayment());
bool success = paymentContext.ProcessPayment(amount, paymentDetails);
```

### 4. Repository Pattern (Layered Abstraction)
**Implementation**: 
- `IRepository<T>` generic interface
- `ProductRepository` and `OrderRepository` implementations

Provides abstraction over data access layer with generic CRUD operations and specific queries.

**Benefits**:
- Separates business logic from data access
- Enables unit testing with mock repositories
- Provides consistent data access interface

**Key Features**:
- Generic repository interface with common CRUD operations
- Specific repository interfaces with domain-specific queries
- Async operations for better performance

## SOLID Principles Application

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `Product` classes handle product-specific behavior
- `OrderService` manages order operations
- `PaymentStrategy` implementations handle specific payment types
- `Logger` handles only logging operations

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New product types can be added by extending `Product` class
- New payment methods can be added by implementing `IPaymentStrategy`
- New repositories can be added by implementing `IRepository<T>`

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes can replace their base classes:
- All product types can be used wherever `Product` is expected
- All payment strategies can be used interchangeably
- Repository implementations can be substituted without breaking functionality

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces are specific and focused:
- `ILogger` contains only logging methods
- `IConfigurationManager` contains only configuration methods
- `IPaymentStrategy` contains only payment-related methods

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions:
- Services depend on repository interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Payment context depends on strategy interface
- Application uses interface references where possible

## Application Features

### Menu System
The console application provides a comprehensive menu-driven interface:

1. **View Products** - Display all products with detailed information
2. **Add New Product** - Create new products of different categories
3. **Create Order** - Generate new customer orders
4. **Process Payment** - Handle payments using different strategies
5. **View Orders** - Display order history and details
6. **Check Inventory** - Inventory management and stock checking
7. **System Logs** - View application logs
8. **Configuration** - View and modify system settings
9. **Exit** - Gracefully shutdown the application

### Product Management
- Support for four product categories: Electronics, Clothing, Books, Home & Garden
- Category-specific properties and validation
- Stock management and tracking
- Low stock alerts

### Order Processing
- Create orders for customers
- Add multiple items to orders
- Calculate order totals automatically
- Track order status (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)
- Order history and customer-specific orders

### Payment Processing
- Multiple payment strategies with unique validation logic
- Runtime payment method selection
- Payment success/failure simulation
- Secure payment detail handling

### Logging & Configuration
- Centralized logging with timestamps and severity levels
- Thread-safe singleton implementation
- Configuration management for application settings
- Log viewing and configuration modification through menu

## Technical Highlights

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling throughout the application:
- Try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Graceful handling of invalid operations
- Detailed error logging

### Async/Await Pattern
Repository operations use async/await for better performance:
- All database operations are asynchronous
- Proper async method naming conventions
- Task-based return types

### Thread Safety
Singleton implementations are thread-safe:
- Use of `Lazy<T>` for initialization
- Lock statements for critical sections
- Thread-safe collections where appropriate

### Validation
Multiple layers of validation:
- Domain model validation in product classes
- Payment detail validation in strategy implementations
- Business logic validation in service layer
- Input validation in presentation layer

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Type Safety with Factory Pattern
**Problem**: Ensuring type safety when creating products with dynamic parameters.
**Solution**: Used strongly-typed Dictionary<string, object> for parameters and implemented proper validation in factory methods.

### Challenge 2: Thread-Safe Singletons
**Problem**: Ensuring thread safety in singleton implementations.
**Solution**: Used `Lazy<T>` initialization pattern and lock statements for critical sections.

### Challenge 3: Payment Strategy Validation
**Problem**: Different payment methods require different validation rules.
**Solution**: Implemented validation logic within each strategy and used a common interface for consistency.

### Challenge 4: Repository Pattern with In-Memory Storage
**Problem**: Simulating database operations without actual database.
**Solution**: Used List<T> collections with proper exception handling and async delay simulation.
